## 🚀 Features

- **Intuitive Commands**: Interact with your terminal using natural language
- **Smart Environment Management**: Create and manage virtual environments effortlessly
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed for seamless operation on various operating systems (macOS support available now, Windows coming soon)
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, maximum performance

## 🛠 Installation

Getting started with NLT is as simple as speaking your mind. Install it using pip:

```bash
python -m pip install nlt
```

## 🌟 Quick Start

After installation, initialize NLT globally on your device:

```bash
@nls init
```

## 🔮 Usage

### Creating a New Environment

Create a new environment as easily as describing it:

```bash
@cls create my_awesome_project
```

This creates a new folder in your current directory.

### Activating an Environment

Activate your new environment with a simple source command:

```bash
source bin/my_awesome_project
```

### Deactivating and Cleaning Up

To deactivate your current environment:

```bash
remove
```

To remove the environment and clean up:

```bash
remove -c
```

or

```bash
remove --clean
```

## 🔧 How It Works

NLT leverages cutting-edge natural language processing to interpret your commands and translate them into powerful terminal operations. It creates a layer of abstraction that allows you to focus on your intentions rather than syntax.
